                        <p class='exp_text'>Over the past year, I have dedicated myself to transition from a career as a
                             video producer to a front-end developer. My goal is to leverage my aesthetic sense, attention 
                             to detail and passion for creating to build exciting and interesting web experiences.

                      <p class='exp_text'>In the course of preparing to become a front-end developer I’ve leaned
                           on a lesson I learned a long time ago: Don’t try to learn everything, focus on knowing 
                           how to ask the right questions and where to find the answers. It’s a skill I’ve used 
                           throughout my career and, I believe, makes me a valuable, versatile and resourceful member 
                           of any team. My comfort level with various skills and languages is listed below, but I 
                           have primarily focused on HTML, CSS and JS with heavy use of React and SASS. I’m proud 
                           of the work I’ve produced and am excited to put my skills to use.

                                    I started my career as a Combat Photographer in the United States Marine Corps. 
                                    It was in the Marine Corps where I attended photography school. On top of the skills 
                                    and responsibilities expected of all Marines, I was charged with creating images both 
                                    artistic and technical. The unofficial motto of the Marine Corps is “Improvise, Adapt 
                                    and Overcome.” It’s a mindset I’ve carried with me throughout my career.

                                    At the completion of my military contract I landed at a local television station in Sarasota, Florida. 
                                    As a video journalist I shot, edited and reported thousands of stories. I covered stories ranging from 
                                    the humorous to the tragic, often times in the same day. In this high pressure, fast turn-around 
                                    environment the emphasis is on being quick but accurate. During my time at the station I rose from 
                                    weekend and night photographer to Chief Photographer and Operations Manager.

                            <div class="exp_connector"></div>
                            <p class='exp_text'>My next step was to NYC working for The Associated Press. I was hired to help launch the 
                                AP’s online video service. I was responsible for all online entertainment, sports and business video content.  
                                    Once that project was launched I moved to AP’s experimental storytelling department. I worked with 
                                    journalists, designers and developers to produce videos, slideshows, podcasts, web interactives and more. 
                                    I was then tasked with launching the AP’s fashion, food and travel online video service.

                            <p class='exp_text'>In 2012, we left New York for Kentucky so that my wife could advance her career.
                                 While there, I started a video production company focusing on commercials and corporate videos. 
                                 The majority of my clients were small businesses without in-house creative resources which meant
                                  I often managed a project from concept through execution.

                            <div class="exp_connector"></div>
                            <p class='exp_text'>After two years in Kentucky, we headed out to Seattle so that I could take the position 
                                of Video Production Manager for KCTS9, the local PBS affiliate. While at KCTS9 I launched several new 
                                programs and led a team 30 photographers, editors and production crew. I’ve since moved on to contract
                                 and consultant positions which have allowed me to focus on my web development education.
